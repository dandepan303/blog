  - title: Beatbox (English Version) - NCT DREAM (9/10)
    description: NCT Dream tracks can be extremely hit or miss, With March 25’s god awful Smoothie being the direct following to Broken Melodies, One of the most compelling rock ballads that SM entertainment had put out to date. So needless to say I was elated to hear the hard hitting, masterclass in sound design that was Beatbox. The light use of instrumental in the background let the group's incredibly strong vocals shine through, which is a refreshing feeling from the terribly mixed songs that SM has put out of late. Beatbox’s chorus was also a welcome departure from the one word gimmick garbage that NCT had put out in songs like, well smoothie, with Beatboxe’s having that kind of stuck-in-your-head rhythm that no nct unit other than Dream can create. In essence, Beatbox, while not exactly groundbreaking, is some of the best work by NCT Dream.
