  - title: Beatbox (English Version) - NCT DREAM (9/10)
    description: NCT Dream tracks can be extremely hit or miss, With March 25’s god awful Smoothie being the direct following to Broken Melodies, One of the most compelling rock ballads that SM entertainment had put out to date. So needless to say I was elated to hear the hard hitting, masterclass in sound design that was Beatbox. The light use of instrumental in the background let the group's incredibly strong vocals shine through, which is a refreshing feeling from the terribly mixed songs that SM has put out of late. Beatbox’s chorus was also a welcome departure from the one word gimmick garbage that NCT had put out in songs like, well smoothie, with Beatboxe’s having that kind of stuck-in-your-head rhythm that no nct unit other than Dream can create. In essence, Beatbox, while not exactly groundbreaking, is some of the best work by NCT Dream.

  - title: Dangerous - BOYNEXTDOOR (8.5/10)
    description: BOYNEXTDOOR is KOZ’s One and Only boy group, and after a series of downright incredibly consistent mini-albums, dangerous shows off a different side of BOYNEXTDOOR’s sound. While past releases have opted for a brash, hopeful sound, they have already established a brand, and dangerous is an exploration of a more refined and careful kind of music, but with BOYNEXTDOOR's signature character infused into the tracks. The pre-release single to this album was Dangerous, and compared to the rest of BOYNEXTDOOR's discography it was certainly one of their edgier songs (which doesn't say much). While it doesn't have the shout-out chorus of their other songs, it still has a kind of toe tapping-ness that marks it as one of their most iconic tracks to date. The pre chorus felt like some classic bnd actions but the real punchline of “So what?” relayed into one of the most addictive melodies KOZ has put out. So in other words, while a departure from their old style, Dangerous still has plenty of merit.
