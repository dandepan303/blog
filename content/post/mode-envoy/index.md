Hey! It's me, Dean. Welp, here we are. This is my (almost) selfhosted blog/portfolio/git server for my stuff. I will probably post anything here that I think is interesting.

This site is mostly inspired by my great friend [nixwiz](https://clucknugget.net) and you should check him out. He is way smarter than me and even has an ssh server located on his awesome (truly) selfhosted website.
