> ## QUICK WARNING

> This is not a comprehensive guide. Just a blog post about how I did it myself. If you want to "mod/hack" your switch, I recommend following thourough guides on [switch.hacks.guide](https://switch.hacks.guide) and following the dissassembly guides on [IFIXIT](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Nintendo+Switch+Teardown/78263?srsltid=AfmBOopafqIlha4w_7wViLBNHRTsR9xevz8mXbvGGDWJCnt6BXANPRET).

Hey! It's me, Dean. Welp, here we are. This is my (almost) selfhosted blog/portfolio/git server for my stuff. I will probably post anything here that I think is interesting.

This site is mostly inspired by my great friend [nixwiz](https://clucknugget.net) and you should check him out. He is way smarter than me and even has an ssh server located on his awesome (truly) selfhosted website.
